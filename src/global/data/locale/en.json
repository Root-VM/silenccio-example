The aim of this measure is to increase awareness of and vigilance against potential cyber threats.\nWhat are phishing simulations?\nPhishing simulations are simulated phishing attacks that take place in a controlled environment to check how employees respond to suspicious emails. The aim is to improve the ability of everyone involved to recognise and respond appropriately to real phishing attempts.\nWhat is measured?\n-\tWhether you have received the email\n-\tWhether you have opened the email\n-\tWhether you have clicked on links within the email\n-\tWhether you have transferred data\n-\tWhether you have reported the emails as suspicious\n\nData protection and your consent\nYour privacy is very important to us. Please note that you will only be identified by means of your email address and that all data collected will be treated as strictly confidential. The results of the phishing simulations are used exclusively for training and security purposes.\nWe would like to inform you that you will receive phishing test emails as part of this initiative. Your participation is an important part of our security efforts. If you have any questions, please contact [Responsible office/person] on [Contact information].\nBy continuing to use our IT systems, you agree to participate in this security initiative and to the processing of your data to the extent described. \nThank you in advance for your support and commitment to the security of our company.\n\nKind regards,\n[Responsible office/person]\"\n",
